| Term                  | Definition |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Aspect ratio          | Width-to-height ratio, ensuring undistorted display of 3D scenes. |
| Damping               | Reduction in oscillation amplitude, used for realistic motion in animations. |
| Delta                 | Time difference between current and previous frames, used for smooth motion. |
| Environment mapping   | A classic technique in computer graphics for making objects appear shiny or reflective. |
| Face                  | A flat surface on a 3D shape, formed by connecting vertices. |
| Field of view (FOV)   | The angle encompassing the visible scene through a camera. |
| Frustum culling       | Technique that avoids computation of things that are not visible. |
| Gimbal lock           | A loss in rotation freedom, avoided by using quaternions. |
| HDRI                  | A 360° image for lighting/backgrounds — a mix of images (of different exposures) of the same scene. |
| Library               | A collection of pre-written code for common tasks. |
| Matrix                | A mathematical construct for 3D point transformations. |
| MatCaps               | Images used as textures to fake a whole material including lighting and reflections. |
| Mipmapping            | Using pre-scaled textures to improve performance by reducing aliasing and moiré as objects scale. |
| Normal                | A vector perpendicular to a surface, used in lighting calculations. |
| Pixel ratio           | The ratio of physical to logical pixels, essential for sharp displays on high-DPI screens. |
| Quaternion            | A mathematical representation of 3D rotations, preventing gimbal lock. |
| Shader                | A program for calculating pixel and vertex attributes during rendering. |
| Tween                 | The process of creating smooth transitions between two states or images. |
| UV Mapping            | The process of projecting a 2D image texture onto a 3D model's surface. |
| Vertex                | A point in 3D space with coordinates, used to define 3D shapes. |
| Viewport              | The on-screen area where 3D scenes are rendered. |
| Z-fighting            | A rendering issue causing flickering/zebra-striping when two objects occupy the same space. |
