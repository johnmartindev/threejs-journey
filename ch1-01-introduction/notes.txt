# Notes

## Overall impressions:

The main take-away from this introduction is that ThreeJS is now a stable, mature technology.
It is capable of producing a vast array of media for all sorts of projects (as seen on ThreeJs.org examples).

Simon warns that some parts of the course (particularly the section on shaders) causes a lot of people to struggle.
While difficult and/or boring, it's important to power through such content.

"If it's hard to learn, it's valuable knowledge"!
