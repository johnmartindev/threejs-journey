# Notes

## What is Three.js:

- Three.js is a 3D JavaScript library.
- It uses the MIT license.
- It was created by "Mr. Doob", aka. Ricardo Cabello.
- It enables developers to create 3D experiences for the web.
- It works with WebGL, but can also work with SVG and CSS (in limited ways).
- See the change logs on the Three.js Github repo for changes.

## Applications of the technology:

- Rich interactive imagery: https://www.oculus.com/medal-of-honor/?locale=en_GB
- Motion graphics: https://cornrevolution.resn.global/
- Product demonstrations: https://live.vanmoof.com/
- Selectable, animated maps: https://chartogne-taillet.com/en
- Flow field effects (particle effects)
- Videogames: https://heraclosgame.com/, https://letsplay.ouigo.es/
- And so much more.

## What is WebGL?

- WebGL is a JavaScript API.
- Can render triangles very efficiently.
- Results can be drawn in <canvas> element (HTML5).
- Compatible with most modern browsers.
- Uses the user's GPU which makes it really fast — can do thousands of parallel calculations. CPUs have multiple cores but typically JavaScript in the browser uses one of them so the calculations occur one at a time (blocking).
- WebGL can be used for 2D as well, but we will focus on 3D.
- WebGL uses instructions called "shaders" to place points and draw pixels (to colourise and place).
- Native WebGL is hard. Drawing a single triangle on the canvas takes at least 100 lines of code.
- Three.js helps by offering a level of abstraction above WebGL — making it easier for us developers.


## Other libraries

- There are other WebGL libraries, but they aren't as popular or as stable.
